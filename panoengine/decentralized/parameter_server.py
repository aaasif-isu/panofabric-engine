# Both ends of the HeLoCo RL parameter-server wire:
#   - the standalone server PROCESS (``python -m ...parameter_server``), the
#     heloco_async_inference hub when run with ``--relay_addr``; and
#   - ``HeLoCoRLClient``, the in-replica client the trainers embed.
# Colocated so the wire contract (``param_metadata`` name ordering, the flat
# coalesced buffer layout) has a single home.
#
# Builds the authoritative *unsharded, fp32, CPU* global model, wraps it in
# torchft's HeLoCo parameter server (the system's outer optimizer: direction-
# aware, heterogeneity-aware staleness correction; ``--outer_method diloco``
# swaps in plain async DiLoCo, same wire protocol), prints the addresses
# replicas connect to, and serves until killed.
#
# With ``--relay_addr`` set, it additionally runs the heloco_async_inference
# hub role: a watch loop on ``server.status()["revision"]`` that, every
# ``publish_every_revisions`` commits, snapshots the global model (bf16),
# shards it, and publishes to the SEPARATE relay process over HTTP via
# RelayClient. The strategy's coordination plane is three CPU processes
# (split so the multi-GB checkpoint traffic, the rollout traffic, and the
# HeLoCo merge math never share a Python process -- and its GIL/event loop; a
# colocated publish could stall rollout pops for 30s+):
#   - THIS process: the HeLoCo/AsyncDiLoCo parameter server (torchft's own
#     HTTP server runs in background threads) + the optional publish loop.
#   - relay: checkpoint distribution to the generator pool.
#   - rollout_queue: the shared rollout queue every trainer replica pops from
#     and every generator worker pushes into.
#
# It also provides ``param_metadata`` (the single source of truth for parameter
# name ordering) and the server/optimizer factories with the outer-method flag.

    ``AsyncDiLoCoServer`` for the format); only the model-facing side
    (state dicts instead of an ``nn.Module``, explicit drivers instead of an
    optimizer post-step hook) is replaced here.

        param_shapes: ``{name: shape}`` for unflattening the received
            global parameters.
        param_dtypes: ``{name: dtype}`` for the local global-parameter
            snapshot. Should be the server's storage dtype (fp32).
        heartbeat_address: Optional ``/heartbeat`` URL from
            :py:meth:`AsyncDiLoCoServer.heartbeat_address`.
        heartbeat_interval: Seconds between heartbeat pings.
        should_quantize: Upload pseudo-gradients as blockwise symmetric int8
            (the parameter download stays float32). Must match the server.
        sync_timeout: Socket timeout per sync request. Must exceed the
            server's ``grace_period`` and any stall the server can hit
            mid-body; see ``AsyncDiLoCoServer.request_timeout``. Nothing in
